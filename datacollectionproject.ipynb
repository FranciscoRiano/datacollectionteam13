Grounded in the conviction that great leadership can be taught and learned, this world-class degree for distinguished working professionals is delivered by renowned faculty who pioneered these principles of leadership. Weatherhead\\\\u2019s Executive MBA (EMBA) program will help you examine your leadership strengths and gaps and develop a personalized learning plan to become the best leader you can be. For decades, Weatherhead\\\\u2019s organizational behavior faculty members have built a best-in-class reputation for teaching the art of leadership. You will learn from the originators of these breakthrough business concepts: Appreciative Inquiry Emotional Intelligence Intentional Change Theory Sustainable Value Flourishing Learning to Manage by Designing Learning Styles Experiential Learning Model Join over 1,000 leaders who have accessed new reserves of energy and leadership potential through the Weatherhead EMBA. Is the Executive MBA Program Right for Me? Participants in Weatherhead\\\\u2019s EMBA program arrive with an average of 15 years of professional experience and aim to ascend to senior leadership roles. With this in mind, courses are designed to approach critical disciplines like strategy, finance, marketing, and accounting through the lens of leadership. Together with the faculty, students examine how the assets created in\\\\u2014and the products and services designed by\\\\u2014these fields enable leadership teams throughout an organization to function most effectively. The Weatherhead model of classroom interaction allows faculty and students to share their knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, projects assigned across courses and disciplines enable students to apply what they have learned in their work environment to their scholastic undertakings. Four Elements of the Weatherhead EMBA Managers create the worlds in which we work and live. In order to best prepare executives for this task, the Weatherhead EMBA is organized around four elements: The development of leadership skills at the levels of self, team, organization, and society. The sociopolitical structures in which leadership is most needed, including government, the world economy, and the rapidly changing realm of technology. The language of business, with a special focus on how it is spoken in the boardroom. The achievement of change in organizations by leading design-oriented teams. These four elements create a leadership package that will prime the student executive to assume a more responsible and influential position in an existing organization or to build a dynamic new organization. Together, these skills help leaders act with confidence and decisiveness in the face of uncertainty. Time Commitment With only 16 total 3-day visits to campus, the Weatherhead EMBA is designed to be manageable for busy executives, allowing students from around the world to participate in a one-of-a-kind leadership program. While the on-campus requirements are minimal, the EMBA program demands a serious time commitment from each participant. Although individual study habits vary, successful students may devote 10-15 hours per week to the program. \\\\u201cOne of the distinguishing characteristics of the Weatherhead EMBA program is the focus on organizational behavior and leadership topics as well as Appreciative Inquiry, and those fields of study that really help set the employees who have gone through that program apart from employees who have gone through other programs. Weatherhead graduates have a much stronger appreciation of how elements of leadership are important and how they help drive change in an organization.\\\\u201d\\\\u2014 Linda Rae, General Manager, Power Generation, and Oil &amp;amp; Gas, GE Digital What\\\\u2019s the return on investment for this Executive\\\\u00a0MBA\\\\u00a0degree?

Both fall and spring semesters are comprised of four 3-day visits. These visits take place once a month, Thursday through Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The summer semester is delivered abroad through the weeklong International Study Experience. The Weatherhead EMBA is a lock-step cohort program. A new EMBA cohort begins each September. Participants self-select learning teams, which represent essential study partnerships over the course of the program as well as invaluable resources for networking and organizational support. Learning teams often grow as close as a second family, with members establishing impactful, life-long relationships. Team members go on to be each other&#039;s mentors, advisers, and even employers. Learning teams meet weekly outside of the classroom, either face-to-face or remotely, to achieve course objectives and enhance the learning experience. In addition, faculty often host optional study and review sessions, which are also recorded for virtual access. Executive Coaching Component The Executive MBA curriculum emphasizes a unique, personalized approach to learning, with a focus on self-awareness as the key to becoming an effective leader. Each candidate in the Weatherhead EMBA program is assigned an executive coach who helps him or her take full advantage of the academic experience while providing guidance as he or she develops as an individual and leader. Weatherhead\\\\u2019s Executive MBA Application Project Weatherhead\\\\u2019s EMBA degree program includes an in-depth application project that integrates design practices in management education. Each student spends a semester exploring his or her organization for a \\\\u201cdesign opportunity\\\\u201d\\\\u2014an opportunity to create value by deploying resources and capabilities in new ways. Students assume leadership responsibility and, with the support of a team of peers in the program, execute a design project that generates a return for the organization. International Study Experience Each EMBA cohort chooses its destinations for the trip, which typically occurs around mid-June and lasts about 8 to 10 days. During the summer semester, students travel abroad for a portion of the program during which faculty reinforce business fundamentals through a global lens. Weatherhead faculty and experienced professionals from institutions and organizations worldwide coordinate hands-on activities with global and local entities, as well as in an academic setting, in the region selected for that year\\\\u2019s study experience. Students explore the nature of global leadership and operations while improving their understanding of the role of culture in business and society. They return to their own organization with a renewed commitment to employ the knowledge, skills, and holistic perspective developed during their experience abroad to benefit their colleagues at home. Students generally visit two different countries as part of their tour. Previous cohorts have traveled to such destinations as Spain, Morocco, Greece, South Africa, Argentina, Vietnam, China, Sweden, Latvia, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, London, Milan, Ireland, Scotland, Hungary, and Romania.

Four Elements of the Weatherhead EMBA Managers create the worlds in which we work and live. In order to best prepare executives for this task, the Weatherhead EMBA is organized around four elements: The development of leadership skills at the levels of self, team, organization, and society. The sociopolitical structures in which leadership is most needed, including government, the world economy, and the rapidly changing realm of technology. The language of business, with a special focus on how it is spoken in the boardroom. The achievement of change in organizations by leading design-oriented teams. These four elements create a leadership package that will prime the student executive to assume a more responsible and influential position in an existing organization or to build a dynamic new organization. Together, these skills help leaders act with confidence and decisiveness in the face of uncertainty. Time Commitment With only 16 total 3-day visits to campus, the Weatherhead EMBA is designed to be manageable for busy executives, allowing students from around the world to participate in a one-of-a-kind leadership program.

Although individual study habits vary, successful students may devote 10-15 hours per week to the program. \\\\u201cOne of the distinguishing characteristics of the Weatherhead EMBA program is the focus on organizational behavior and leadership topics as well as Appreciative Inquiry, and those fields of study that really help set the employees who have gone through that program apart from employees who have gone through other programs. Weatherhead graduates have a much stronger appreciation of how elements of leadership are important and how they help drive change in an organization.\\\\u201d\\\\u2014 Linda Rae, General Manager, Power Generation, and Oil &amp;amp; Gas, GE Digital What\\\\u2019s the return on investment for this Executive\\\\u00a0MBA\\\\u00a0degree?

Both fall and spring semesters are comprised of four 3-day visits. These visits take place once a month, Thursday through Saturday, from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The summer semester is delivered abroad through the weeklong International Study Experience. The Weatherhead EMBA is a lock-step cohort program. A new EMBA cohort begins each September. Participants self-select learning teams, which represent essential study partnerships over the course of the program as well as invaluable resources for networking and organizational support. Learning teams often grow as close as a second family, with members establishing impactful, life-long relationships. Team members go on to be each other&#039;s mentors, advisers, and even employers. Learning teams meet weekly outside of the classroom, either face-to-face or remotely, to achieve course objectives and enhance the learning experience. In addition, faculty often host optional study and review sessions, which are also recorded for virtual access. Executive Coaching Component The Executive MBA curriculum emphasizes a unique, personalized approach to learning, with a focus on self-awareness as the key to becoming an effective leader. Each candidate in the Weatherhead EMBA program is assigned an executive coach who helps him or her take full advantage of the academic experience while providing guidance as he or she develops as an individual and leader.

During the summer semester, students travel abroad for a portion of the program during which faculty reinforce business fundamentals through a global lens. Weatherhead faculty and experienced professionals from institutions and organizations worldwide coordinate hands-on activities with global and local entities, as well as in an academic setting, in the region selected for that year\\\\u2019s study experience. Students explore the nature of global leadership and operations while improving their understanding of the role of culture in business and society. They return to their own organization with a renewed commitment to employ the knowledge, skills, and holistic perspective developed during their experience abroad to benefit their colleagues at home. Students generally visit two different countries as part of their tour.
